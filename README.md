# Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Minimax Algorithm)

This project is an AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe game using the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**.  
The AI plays optimally, meaning if you play perfectly, the game will always result in a **tie**!   

## **Project Files**
- `runner.py` → Runs the **graphical user interface (GUI)** of the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- `tictactoe.py` → Implements the **game logic and AI** using Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
- `test_tictactoe.py` → A test file to verify **individual functions** before running the game.

Tic-Tac-Toe AI is Complete!
🏆 AI plays optimally (Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning)
✅ Fully implemented and tested
🎮 GUI interface for easy play
🛠️ Separate test file for debugging.
